# SquatchWatch
This is a program simulation for a bigfoot reasercher company.  It uses MySQL for the database, Java for the buisness logic, and Web UI for front end.  The main feature of this is dynamic catalog of items, they can be added or deleted, based on the level of administration.  Using Spring Security I both hide and alter user abilities, with four different access levels.  The items feature a name, cost, description, picture, and tags. Each of these categories can be filtered either together or individual when searching for items.  Home page features a dynamic 'featured items' list with name and picture, which can only be added or removed by management.

**cooperation**

this was created in a group collaboration project.  Four of us in total over a short agile approach.
